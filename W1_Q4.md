##  Reverse Engineering Write-Up: **TodoMVC (React Example)**

---

###  Project Overview

**Repository**: [tastejs/todomvc (React)](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/react)
**Project Name**: TodoMVC – React Implementation
**Purpose**: Demonstrates best practices for building a simple CRUD application using React.
**Functionality**: A to-do list app that allows users to add, view, filter, complete, and delete tasks.

---

###  Project Objectives

* Show how React handles component-based architecture.
* Implement all core features of a task manager using minimal dependencies.
* Demonstrate integration with browser `localStorage` for state persistence.

###  Codebase Structure

```
/react
├── app.css         # Basic styling
├── app.js          # Root React component
├── footer.js       # Displays task count, filters, clear-completed
├── header.js       # Handles input for new tasks
├── index.html      # Base HTML
├── main.js         # Entry point for rendering the app
├── todoItem.js     # Represents a single to-do item
├── todoModel.js    # Model for state & localStorage logic
└── utils.js        # Helper functions (e.g., for UUID, pluralization)
```

###  Technology Stack

| Layer        | Technology                                                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| View (UI)    | React (Class-based components)                                 |
| State        | Local component state                                          |
| Persistence  | Browser `localStorage`                                         |
| Architecture | MVC-like (React for View & Controller, todoModel.js for Model) |

### ⚙ Component Responsibilities

| Component      | Responsibility                                              |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| `main.js`      | Entry point: renders root component (`App`)                 |
| `app.js`       | Central state manager: manages todos, filters, handles CRUD |
| `header.js`    | Input field for adding tasks                                |
| `todoItem.js`  | Renders each to-do, handles toggling, editing, deleting     |
| `footer.js`    | Displays filter options, task count, and clear button       |
| `todoModel.js` | Manages persistence (load/save to localStorage)             |
| `utils.js`     | Helper utilities for formatting and UUID generation         |

---

###  Data Flow

The app follows **unidirectional data flow**, which is idiomatic in React:

1. **User adds/edits task** → `header.js` / `todoItem.js`
2. **State updated in `app.js`** via `setState()`
3. **State is passed down as props** to child components (`todoItem.js`, `footer.js`)
4. **Changes are persisted** in localStorage via `todoModel.js`

---

###  State Management

* **Centralized in `app.js`**: holds the full list of todos and the current filter.
* Each todo is an object:

  ```js
  {
    id: 'unique-id',
    title: 'Task title',
    completed: false
  }
  ```
* The app filters todos dynamically using the selected filter (`all`, `active`, `completed`).

---

###  Persistence Layer

* Managed in `todoModel.js`
* Uses browser's `localStorage` with a key like `'react-todos'`
* Saves the entire list of todos as JSON.
* Fetches data on component mount in `app.js`.

---

###  Key Observations

* **Best Practices**: Clear separation of concerns, React idioms (controlled components, prop drilling, unidirectional flow).
* **Class-Based Components**: Modern React favors hooks and functional components. This project is an example of pre-hooks architecture.
* **Maintainability**: Easy to extend or refactor due to clean structure.
* **Lightweight Model Layer**: Custom implementation instead of external state managers like Redux.

###  Strengths & Weaknesses

| Strengths                                    | Weaknesses                                        |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Clean, modular code structure                | Uses outdated class-based components              |
| Demonstrates full CRUD + filtering + storage | No unit tests included                            |
| Easy to understand and modify                | No support for server-side or multi-user data     |
| Fully client-side, fast and responsive       | Not scalable for large-scale apps without changes |

---

###  Conclusion

The React implementation of TodoMVC is an excellent small-scale application that demonstrates:

* Component-based architecture
* Local state and storage handling
* React's rendering and update cycle
* MVC-like abstraction using a model file (`todoModel.js`)

It serves as a great foundation for learning or teaching frontend development and can be modernized using functional components and React Hooks for improved readability and performance.
